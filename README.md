# Miller_Bootstrap
Parks &amp; Rec List of Characters. Is a first experiment using Bootstrap.

Had trouble incorporating personal css into file, confused on priority of bootstrap classes vs specific rules in .css file or LESS rules.

Tried to change the icon on the left and all icons shrank to 1px tall. Have been working on making those icons re-appear for ~7 hours now with no success. Submitting as is due to Overdue status, will continue to work on issue and create branch with correct changes when they are made.
